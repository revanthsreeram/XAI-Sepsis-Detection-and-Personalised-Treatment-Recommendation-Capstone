# XAI-Sepsis-Detection-and-Personalised-Treatment-Recommendation-Capstone
This repository is for the capstone/final year project titled “From Black box to Bedside: XAI for Disease Detection and Personalized Sepsis Care”
The project utilises Explainable AI/XAI tools and techniques to make a medical system more explainable, interpretable and understandable to medical professionals and patients.
As a proof of concept, sepsis was taken up.
The system includes a disease classifier, personalised treatment recommender, and a RAG supported report generator that presents the systems findings in a user centric way for better understandability.
